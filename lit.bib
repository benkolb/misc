	accumulation and economic growth. Yet the question of what characteristics
	should be examined to determine whether actual economies are dynamically
	efficient is unresolved. This paper develops a criterion for determining
	whether an economy is dynamically efficient. The criterion, which
	holds for economies in which technological progress and population
	are stochastic, involves a comparison of the cash flows generated
	by capital with the level of investment. Its application to the U.S.
	economy and the economies of other major OECD nations suggests that
	they are dynamically efficient. Copyright 1989 by The Review of Economic

	but also compromises market discipline by making bank debt too safe.

	in the integrated approach to the empirical application of dynamic

	The standard BS model implies a cointegration relationship between
	relative prices and sectoral productivities. While this link generally
	seems to exist, the magnitudes of the parameter estimates are not
	in accordance with the theoretical model in most countries. As the
	presumed uniformity of sectoral wages is rejected in most cases,
	relative wages were allowed to enter the estimation. This extended
	BS model is endorsed by the data in every country. Simulations based
	on these results were carried out to quantify possible inflation
	differentials. Setting EMU-wide inflation equal to 2 per cent and
	assuming that PPP holds for traded goods, the projected inflation
	varies around the EMU-average within a margin of some +/-1 percentage

	in the baseline real-time oil price forecast. Such risk analysis
	helps forecast users understand what assumptions are driving the

	the use of these tools in conjunction with reduced-form vector autoregressive

	agent framework can explain an expansion driven by the growth in
	consumer debt, and why the equilibrium path of such an economy is
	likely fragile. In particular, we demonstrate that the emergence
	of a small amount of asymmetric information can make the economy
	susceptible to changes in expectations that can induce large reversals
	of financial flows, the freezing of assets and a recession that can
	persist despite high productivity.}

	a two-region, general equilibrium model with monopolistic competition
	and price stickiness. This framework delivers a simple welfare criterion
	based on the utility of the consumers that has the usual trade-off
	between stabilizing inflation and output. If the two regions share
	the same degree of nominal rigidity, the terms of trade are completely
	insulated from monetary policy and the optimal outcome is obtained
	by targeting a weighted average of the regional inflation rates.
	These weights coincide with the economic sizes of the region. If
	the degrees of rigidity are different, the optimal plan implies a
	high degree of inertia in the inflation rate. But an inflation targeting
	policy in which higher weight is given to the inflation in the region
	with higher degrees of nominal rigidity is nearly optimal.<P>(This

	expectations equilibrium, and that policies approximating strict
	inflation-forecast targeting are likely to have undesirable properties.
	We also show that economies with more general forecast-based policy
	rules are particularly susceptible to indeterminacy of rational expectations
	equilibria. We conclude that, although private-sector forecasts may

	used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid
	drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs
	because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their

	pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium
	term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot
	in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks
	generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact
	of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations
	on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing.

  abstract = {The financial market turmoil in 2007 and 2008 has led to the most
	severe financial crisis since the Great Depression and threatens
	to have large repercussions on the real economy. The bursting of
	the housing bubble forced banks to write down several hundred billion
	dollars in bad loans caused by mortgage delinquencies. At the same
	time, the stock market capitalization of the major banks declined
	by more than twice as much. While the overall mortgage losses are
	large on an absolute scale, they are still relatively modest compared
	to the $8 trillion of U.S. stock market wealth lost between October
	2007, when the stock market reached an all-time high, and October
	2008. This paper attempts to explain the economic mechanisms that
	caused losses in the mortgage market to amplify into such large dislocations
	and turmoil in the financial markets, and describes common economic
	threads that explain the plethora of market declines, liquidity dry-ups,
	defaults, and bailouts that occurred after the crisis broke in summer

  abstract = {Purpose – The Maastricht inflation criterion has influenced the choice
	of disinflation strategies of prospective euro area member countries.
	Some historically high-inflation countries chose the fiat disinflation
	strategy of “low inflation now, reforms later,” bringing inflation
	down quickly. Their inflation rates increased immediately after their
	euro applications were assessed positively and stayed significantly
	higher than inflation in France and Germany, two historically low-inflation
	countries. The inflation differentials reflect both structural rigidities
	inherited from the past and higher inflation expectations stemming
	from the chosen disinflation strategy. This paper seeks to address
	these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The paper highlights
	the inflation consequences of the choice of compliance policies with
	the Maastricht inflation criterion. To this end, the paper estimates
	costs of future disinflations in six high-inflation countries for
	which well-established stylized facts are held. Findings – The Maastricht
	inflation criterion has been an influential nominal rule. While it
	swayed the public stance toward low inflation, it biased the choice
	of the disinflation strategy toward fiat measures. Inflation in these
	countries declined only temporarily, giving these countries a pronounced
	V-shaped pattern of inflation. These countries tended to opt for
	“low inflation now, reforms later” approach, which yielded low inflation
	quickly at the cost of postponing long-term structural reforms. While
	the ERM II process can be made relatively painless by fiat measures,
	such a strategy results in inefficient transmission mechanisms and
	costly disinflations. Originality/value – The paper highlights the
	long-run inflation consequences of the choice of compliance policies
	with the Maastricht inflation criterion. While inflation was low
	prior to the euro and stayed low afterward in inflation-averse countries,

	Union financial integration. The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)
	is the first element of the banking union. From the point of view
	of non-euro countries, the draft SSM regulation as amended by the
	EU Council includes strong safeguards relating to decision-making,
	accountability, attention to financial stability in small countries
	and the applicability of national macroprudential measures. Non-euro
	countries will also have the right to leave the SSM and thereby exempt

	bring the full benefits of the banking union, but would foster financial
	integration, improve the supervision of cross-border banks, ensure
	greater consistency of supervisory practices, increase the quality
	of supervision, avoid competitive distortions and provide ample supervisory
	information. While the decision to join the SSM is made difficult
	by uncertainty surrounding other elements of the banking union, including
	possible burden sharing, we conclude that non-euro EU members should
	stand ready to join the SSM and be prepared for negotiations on the
	other elements of the banking union.},

	research field on endogenous risk in a macroeconomic context, are
	based on sophisticated solution methods that are not easily applicable

	us to capture some of the basic insights of this literature in a
	standard macro-model. We are able to identify an important risk-channel
	that derives from the risk aversion of constrained intermediaries
	and that contributes significantly to the overall financial and macro
	volatility. With this procedure, we obtain a consistent and computationally-efficient
	modelling device that can be used for integrating financial stability

	choice with households facing idiosyncratic uninsurable earnings

	provide collateral for loans. To analyze the impact of preferential
	housing taxation on the tenure choice and the bias, we consider a
	tax system that mimics that of the U.S. economy. Namely, owner-occupied
	housing services are not taxed and mortgage interest payments are
	deductible. Through simulations, we show that a rental equivalence
	approach (relative to a user cost approach) overestimates the cost
	of housing services. The magnitude of the bias is very sensitive
	to both the income tax rate and the size of adjustment costs in the
	housing market. (Copyright: Elsevier)},

	the Fed’s systematic response to technology shocks and its implications
	for US output, hours and inflation. Second we evaluate the extent
	to which those responses can be accounted for by a simple monetary
	policy rule (including the optimal one) in the context of a standard
	business cycle model with sticky prices. Our main results can be
	described as follows: First, we detect significant differences across
	periods in the response of the economy (as well as the Fed’s) to
	a technology shock. Second, the Fed’s response to a technology shock
	in the Volcker-Greenspan period is consistent with an optimal monetary
	policy rule. Third, in the pre-Volcker period the Fed’s policy tended
	to over stabilize output at the cost of generating excessive inflation
	volatility. Our evidence reinforces recent results in the literature
	suggesting an improvement in the Fed’s performance.<P>(This abstract

	capital out of retained earnings. Loan margins depend on the banks'

	Balance-sheet constraints establish a link between the business cycle,

	of loans. The model is estimated with Bayesian techniques using data

	the banking sector and, in particular, sticky rates attenuate the
	effects of monetary policy shocks, while financial intermediation
	increases the propagation of supply shocks. Second, shocks originating
	in the banking sector explain the largest share of the contraction

  abstract = {There is general agreement that banking supervision and resolution
	have to be organised at the same level. It is often argued, however,
	that there is no need to tackle deposit insurance because it is too
	politically sensitive. This note proposes to apply the principles
	of subsidiarity and re-insurance to deposit insurance: Existing national
	deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) would continue to operate much as
	before (with only minimal standards set by an EU directive), but
	they would be required to take out re-insurance against risks that
	would be too large to be covered by them. A European Reinsurance
	Fund (EReIF) would provide this reinsurance financed by premia paid
	by the national DGSs, just as any reinsurance company does in the
	private sector. The European Fund would pay out only in case of large
	losses. This ‘deductible’ would provide the national authorities
	with the proper incentives, but the reinsurance cover would stabilize
	depositor confidence even in the case of large shocks. Ideally the
	national DGSs would be responsible also for resolution. Experience
	has shown banking systems are more stable if deposit insurers are
	also responsible for resolution. The approach proposed here could
	thus be also used to design the ‘Single Resolution Mechanism’ (SRM)
	which is being discussed as a complement to the ‘Single Supervisory
	Mechanism’ (SSM). It will of course take time to build up the funding
	for such a reinsurance fund. This approach is thus not meant to deal
	with legacy problems from the current crisis.},

	of rapid innovation in the financial industry. This period also saw
	a fall in credit spreads and a boom in liquidity and asset prices
	that accompanied the boom in real activity, especially investment.
	In this paper we argue that these were not unrelated phenomena. The
	adoption of new financial products and practices led to a fall in
	the expected costs of default which in turn engendered the flood
	of liquidity in the financial sector, lowered interest rate spreads
	and facilitated the boom in asset prices and economic activity. When
	the events of 2007-2009 led to a re-evaluation of the effectiveness
	of these new products, agents revised their expectations regarding
	the actual efficiency gains available to the financial sector and
	this led to a withdrawal of liquidity from the financial system,
	a reversal in credit spreads and asset prices and a bust in real
	activity. We treat the efficiency of the financial sector as an exogenous
	process governing bankruptcy (monitoring) costs facing intermediaries
	in a costly state verification framework and study the impact of
	\&quot;news shocks\&quot; regarding this process. Following the expectations
	driven business cycle literature, we model the boom and bust cycle
	in terms of an expected future fall in bankruptcy costs which are
	eventually not realized. The build up in liquidity and economic activity
	in expectation of these efficiency gains is then abruptly reversed
	when agent's hopes are dashed. The model generates counter-cyclical
	movements in the spread between lending rates and the risk-free rate
	which are driven purely by expectations, even in the absence of any
	exogenous movement in intermediation costs as well as an endogenous
	rise and fall in asset prices and leverage.},

	popularity because it can at the same time capture the short-run
	dynamic properties as well as the long-run equilibrium behaviour
	of many non-stationary time series. It also allows relevant economic
	questions to be formulated in a consistent statistical framework.
	Part I of the book is planned so that it can be used by those who
	want to apply the methods without going into too much detail about
	the probability theory. The main emphasis is on the derivation of
	estimators and test statistics through a consistent use of the Guassian
	likelihood function. It is shown that many different models can be
	formulated within the framework of the autoregressive model and the
	interpretation of these models is discussed in detail. In particular,
	models involving restrictions on the cointegration vectors and the
	adjustment coefficients are discussed, as well as the role of the
	constant and linear drift. In Part II, the asymptotic theory is given
	the slightly more general framework of stationary linear processes
	with i.i.d. innovations. Some useful mathematical tools are collected
	in Appendix A, and a brief summary of weak convergence in given in
	Appendix B. The book is intended to give a relatively self-contained
	presentation for graduate students and researchers with a good knowledge
	of multivariate regression analysis and likelihood methods. The asymptotic
	theory requires some familiarity with the theory of weak convergence
	of stochastic processes. The theory is treated in detail with the
	purpose of giving the reader a working knowledge of the techniques
	involved. Many exercises are provided. The theoretical analysis is
	illustrated with the empirical analysis of two sets of economic data.

  abstract = {DYNARE: A program for the simulation of rational expectation models
	Michel Juillard (CEPREMAP and University Paris 8) DYNARE is a user
	oriented general program for the simulation of deterministic or stochastic
	models. For linear models, it implements a generalized Schur decomposition
	algorithm; for deterministic non--linear models, a Newton--type method
	and for stochastic non--linear models, a second order Taylor approximation
	algorithm. The user writes the model and the computational tasks
	to be accomplished in a usual modelling language and in a text file.
	A parser then translates it either in a GAUSS or in a MATLAB program.
	The algorithms are implemented in two libraries, one for GAUSS, one
	for MATLAB. In a deterministic setup, DYNARE can compute the anticipatory
	reaction and the inertial response of a model in the presence of
	one or several fully anticipated shocks, the response to unanticipated
	shocks, the convergence toward equilibrium or the transition between
	two equilibria. It is also possible to add constraints to the model
	such as a liquidity constraint. For stochastic models, DYNARE computes
	a second order Taylor approximation of decision rules. Doing so,
	it takes into account the non certainty equivalence of non--linear
	stochastic models. As it is only an approximation of rational expectations,
	it also provides some measure of the quality of the approximation.
	To our knowledge and to this day, DYNARE is the only general purpose
	simulation program permitting to do so. After a brief review of the
	algorithms, the paper presents a series of experiments that can be
	computed with DYNARE.},

	This finding sits oddly with the observed business cycle comovement
	where consumption, along with hours-worked and investment, moves
	with economic activity. We show that this comovement problem is resolved
	in an estimated DSGE model when (i) the cost of capital utilization
	is specified in terms of increased depreciation of capital, as originally
	proposed by Greenwood et al. (1988) in a neoclassical setting, or
	(ii) there is no wealth effect on labor supply. The data, however,
	favors the first channel. Traditionally, the cost of utilization
	is specified in terms of forgone consumption following Christiano
	et al. (2005), who studied the effects of monetary policy shocks.
	The alternative specification we consider has two additional implications
	relative to the traditional one: (i) it has a substantially better
	fit with the data and (ii) the contribution of investment shocks
	to the variance of consumption is over three times larger. The contributions
	to output, investment, and hours, are also relatively higher, suggesting

  abstract = {Inflation targeting is a monetary policy rule that has implications
	for both the average performance of an economy and its business cycle
	behavior. We use a modern, rational expectations model to study the
	twin effects of this policy rule. The model highlights forward- looking
	consumption and labor supply decisions by households and forward-looking
	investment and price-setting decisions by firms. In it, monetary
	policy has real effects because imperfectly competitive firms are
	constrained to adjust prices only infrequently and satisfy all demand
	at posted prices. In this 'sticky price' model, there are also effects
	of the average rate of inflation on the amount of time that individuals
	must devote to shopping activity and on the average markup of price
	over cost that firms can charge. However, in terms of the welfare
	effects of long-run inflation, it is optimal to set monetary policy
	so that the nominal interest rate is close to zero, replicating in
	an imperfectly competitive model the result that Friedman found under
	perfect competition. A perfect inflation target has desirable effects
	on the response of the macroeconomy to permanent shocks to productivity
	and money demand. Under such a policy rule, the monetary authority
	makes the money supply evolve so a model with sticky prices behaves
	much like one with flexible prices.<P>(This abstract was borrowed

	loans to entrepreneurs, in both countries. It has to finance a fraction
	of loans using equity. We investigate how such a bank capital requirement
	affects the international transmission of productivity and loan default
	shocks. Three findings emerge. First, the bank's capital requirement
	has little effect on the international transmission of productivity
	shocks. Second, the contribution of loan default shocks to business
	cycle fluctuations is negligible under normal economic conditions.
	Third, an exceptionally large loan loss originating in one country
	induces a sizeable and simultaneous decline in economic activity
	in both countries. This is particularly noteworthy, as the 2007-09
	global financial crisis was characterized by large credit losses
	in the US and a simultaneous sharp output reduction in the US and
	the Euro Area. Our results thus suggest that global banks may have
	played an important role in the international transmission of the
	crisis.}

	in home equity borrowing tightens the cash-in-advance constraint,

	of the model. Models estimated with cross-sectional evidence display
	high sensitivity of real activity to nominal credit shocks. Since
	home equity borrowing and public money are, in the model, perfect

	The results are in line with the conventional Real Business Cycle

  abstract = {There are large differences between the microeconometeric estimates
	of the Frisch labor supply elasticity (0-0.5) and the values used
	by macroeconomists to calibrate general equilibrium models (2-4).
	The microeconometric estimates of the Frisch are typically estimated
	by regressing changes in hours on changes in wages conditional on
	the individual being a married male head of household, working some
	minimum number of hours and being of prime working age. In contrast
	macroeconomic calibration values are typically set such that fluctuations
	in a general equilibrium model match the observed changes in the
	aggregate hours and wages from the whole population over time. This
	paper aims to explain the gap by estimating an aggregate Frisch elasticity
	which is consistent with the concept of macro calibration values
	using the microeconometric techniques. In order to estimate the Frisch
	consistent with the macro concept, this paper alters the typical
	microeconometric approach in order to incorporate fluctuations on
	the extensive margin and also broadens the scope of the sample to
	include single males, females, secondary earners, young individuals,
	and old individuals. This paper finds that estimates of the aggregate
	macro Frisch elasticity are in the middle of the range of macroeconomic
	calibration values (around 3.0). Furthermore, it finds that the key
	to explaining the difference are the fluctuations on the extensive
	margin of single males, females, secondary earners, older individuals,

	Our parsimonious model can replicate the time-series for nominal

	and 2012. We then ask how periphery countries would have fared with:
	(i) more conservative fiscal policies; (ii) macro-prudential tools
	to control private leverage; (iii) a central bank acting earlier
	to limit sovereign spreads; and (iv) the possibility to recoup the
	competitiveness they lost in the boom. To perform these counterfactual
	experiments, we use U.S. states as a control group that did not suffer
	from a sudden stop. We find that periphery countries could have stabilized
	their employment if they had followed more conservative fiscal policies
	during the boom. This is especially true in Greece. For Ireland,
	however, given the size of the private leverage boom, such a policy
	would have required buying back almost all of the public debt. Macro-prudential
	policy would have been helpful, especially in Ireland and Spain.
	However, in presence of a spending bias in fiscal rules, macro-prudential
	policies would have led to less prudent fiscal policies in the boom.
	Central bank actions would have stabilized employment during the
	bust but not public debt. Finally, if these countries had been able
	to regain in the bust the competitiveness they lost in the boom,

  type = {Policy Contributions},
  number = {731},
  month = Jun,
  abstract = {This paper discusses the creation of a European Banking Union. First,
	we discuss questions of design. We highlight seven fundamental choices
	that decision makers will need to make: Which EU countries should
	participate in the banking union? To which categories of banks should
	it apply? Which institution should be tasked with supervision? Which
	one should deal with resolution? How centralised should the deposit
	insurance system be? What kind of fiscal backing would be required?
	What governance framework and political institutions would be needed?
	In terms of geographical scope, we see the coverage of the banking
	union of the euro area as necessary and of additional countries as
	desirable, even though this would entail important additional economic
	difficulties. The system should ideally cover all banks within the
	countries included, in order to prevent major competitive and distributional
	distortions. Supervisory authority should be granted either to both
	the ECB and a new agency, or to a new agency alone. National supervisors,
	acting under the authority of the European supervisor, would be tasked
	with the supervision of smaller banks in accordance with the subsidiarity
	principle. A European resolution authority should be established,
	with the possibility of drawing on ESM resources. A fully centralized
	deposit insurance system would eventually be desirable, but a system
	of partial reinsurance may also be envisaged at least in a first
	phase. A banking union would require at least implicit European fiscal
	backing, with significant political authority and legitimacy. Thus,
	banking union cannot be considered entirely separately from fiscal
	union and political union. The most difficult challenge of creating
	a European banking union lies with the short-term steps towards its
	eventual implementation. Many banks in the euro area, and especially
	in the crisis countries, are currently under stress and the move
	towards banking union almost certainly has significant distributio},

	admits a straight-forward efficiency maximization problem, and the

	acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically

  abstract = {Since the seminal papers of Kydland and Prescott (1982) and King,
	Plosser and Rebelo (1988), it has become commonplace in macroeconomics
	to approximate the solution to nonlinear, dynamic general equilibrium
	models using linear methods. Linear approximation methods are useful
	to characterize certain aspects of the dynamic properties of complicated
	models. First-order approximation techniques are not however, well
	suited to handle questions such as welfare comparisons across alternative
	stochastic of policy environments. The problem with using linearized
	decision rules to evaluate second-order approximations to the objective
	function is that some second-order terms of the objective function
	are ignored when using a linearized decision rule. Such problems
	do not arise when the policy function is approximated to second-order
	or higher. In this paper we derive a second order approximation to
	the policy function of a dynamic, rational expectations model. Our
	approach follows the perturbation method described in Judd (1998)
	and developed further by Collard and Juillard(2001). We follow Collard
	and Juillard closely in notation and methodology. An important difference
	separates this Paper from the work of Collard and Juillard. Namely,
	Collard and Juillard apply what they call a bias reduction procedure
	to capture the fact that the policy function depends on the variance
	of the underlying shocks. Instead, we explicitly incorporate a scale
	parameter for the variance of the exogenous shocks as an argument
	of the policy function. In approximating the policy function, we
	take a second order Taylor expansion with respect to the state variables
	as well as this scale parameter. To illustrate its applicability,
	the method is used to solve the dynamics of a simple neoclassical
	model. The Paper closes with a brief description of a set of MATLAB
	programs designed to implement the method.<P>(This abstract was borrowed

	This Paper presents a quantitative comparison of these alternative

	A model with a debt-elastic interest-rate premium; (3) A model with
	convex portfolio adjustment costs; (4) A model with complete asset

	main finding of the Paper is that all models deliver virtually identical

	reviews what we know and don't know about illiquidity and all its
	friends: market freezes, fire sales, contagion, and ultimately insolvencies
	and bailouts. It first explains why liquidity cannot easily be apprehended
	through a single statistic, and asks whether liquidity should be
	regulated given that a capital adequacy requirement is already in
	place. The paper then analyzes market breakdowns due to either adverse
	selection or shortages of financial muscle, and explains why such
	breakdowns are endogenous to balance sheet choices and to information
	acquisition. It then looks at what economics can contribute to the
	debate on systemic risk and its containment. Finally, the paper takes
	a macroeconomic perspective, discusses shortages of aggregate liquidity,
	and analyzes how market value accounting and capital adequacy should
	react to asset prices. It concludes with a topical form of liquidity
	provision, monetary bailouts and recapitalizations, and analyzes
	optimal combinations thereof; it stresses the need for macro-prudential
	policies. ( JEL E44, G01, G21, G28, G32, L51)},

	otherwise standard general equilibrium growth model. A capital requirement
	limits the moral hazard on the part of banks that arises due to deposit
	insurance. However, this capital requirement is also costly because
	it reduces the ability of banks to create liquidity. The key insight
	is that equilibrium asset returns reveal the strength of households'
	preferences for liquidity and this allows for the derivation of a
	simple formula for the welfare cost of capital requirements that
	is a function of observable variables only. Using US data, the welfare
	cost of current capital adequacy regulation is found to be equivalent
	to a permanent loss in consumption of between 0.1\% and 1\%.},

  institution = {Society for Economic Dynamics},
  year = {2013},
  type = {2013 Meeting Papers},
  number = {289},
  abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between sovereign bond spreads,
	local economic activity, and global financial risk. We use secondary-market
	prices of dollar-denominated sovereign securities to construct yield
	spreads between sovereign bond yields and yields on the appropriately
	defined default risk-free securities, constructed using zero-coupon
	U.S. Treasury yields. We use these spreads to construct country-specific
	sovereign bond spreads for a sample of almost 50 countries over the
	1980-2012 period. We then examine the extent to which movements in
	sovereign spreads are determined by local risk factors, such as fluctuations
	in exchange rates and local stock market returns, versus global risk
	factors that arguably proxy for risk-attitudes that prevail in U.S.
	financial markets. To measure global risk factors we rely on the
	excess bond premium constructed by Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012).
	The excess bond premium is a measure of distress in U.S. corporate
	bond markets and comoves closely with conditions in financial markets.
	According to GZ, the excess bond premium provides a quantitative
	measure of the risk-attitudes of financial intermediaries. Our results
	indicate that a substantial portion of the comovement among sovereign
	spreads can be accounted for by changes in such global risk factors.
	We also examine the extent to which, during the 2007-09 financial
	crisis, such global risk factors were related to perceived default
	risk in the U.S. financial sector. Next, we extend our methodology
	to construct credit spreads for euro-denominated sovereign bonds
	for about 40 countries over the 2000-2012 period, and we examine
	the implications of our empirical pricing framework for comovement
	among sovereign spreads during the ongoing turmoil in European sovereign
	debt markets. Lastly, we study the eÂ§ect of various stabilization
	policy announcements during the recent financial crisis on sovereign
	bond spreads through the global risk factors. We also compare the
	impacts },
